# 🥑 Grocer IOS Application
Grocer is an IOS application for showing the demo on SwiftUI. SwiftUI is a new ui toolkit/framework for building rapid and resuable ui components. My experience with swiftui was quite amazing, the ease and the rich set of api's to create almost any ui component had my heart.
